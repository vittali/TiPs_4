[abstract]

I want to connect wireless sensors to a BLE enabled device like a smartphone or tablet.
I am also interested in long range/low volume sensor data transmission (Sub-1GHz).

The {rTI-1} is a tiny board based on the {rTI-2}.
I like it because of:

* the small footprint (32 x 41 mm) allowing for integration
in an existing project (for example via UART)
thus enabling BLE/Sub-1GHz connectivity without having to deal with RF board design,
* the comprehensive set of available sensors.

Getting started with the SensorTag wasn't as easy as I hoped
and this is a write-up of the problems I encountered.

Source code related to this note can be cloned from the {r0}.

== Introduction

The name _CC1350STK_ is the official part number for the development kit,
I will also use the term _SensorTag_ hereafter.
A similar product {rTI-3} with single-band capability is also available {r8}.

== Problems

The problems encountered and discussed on the {rTI-4} revolve around several topics:

. the SensorTag App <<e2e1>>, <<e2e2>>, <<e2e6>>
. installation problems <<e2e11>>
. software availability <<e2e9>>
. choice of the debug probe <<e2e4>>, <<e2e5>>, <<e2e8>>
. project configuration files <<e2e4>>, <<e2e8>>, <<e2e12>>
. connection problems <<e2e4>>, <<e2e10>>


== Hardware Preparation and Requirements

I used the following hardware:

* the {rTI-1}
* the {rTI-5} (not supported, as it turned out) and the {rTI-6}

and the following software;

* Linux Mint 18.2
* Code Composer Studio 9.1 (CCS)
* SimpleLink CC13x0 SDK, version 3.20.0.23 <<st-sw3>>

The Sensor Tag comes with a lithium coin cell.
For development, I prefer a stable lab power supply:

NOTE: Do not leave the coin battery inserted during debugging. The battery will be drained in less than a day.

=== Using the XDS110 debug probe

The {rTI-5} can be hooked up to the SensorTag via a JTAG cable and a small adapter board.

WARNING: while the connection between the probe and the SensorTag is
electrically correct, I was unable to get the XDS110 to work in with the SensorTag.

=== Using the SensorTag DevPack

The {rTI-6} is the recommended probe for the SensorTag.

WARNING: Remove the coin battery, it will be quickly drained by the debug connection.

== Loading the sample project

I used the _uartecho_CC1350STK_ project because it not only serves as a basic sanity check for the environment but also as a proof
that the serial-over-USB host-target connection works as expected.

Download and install the project from the Resource Explorer:

[[uartecho_CC1350STK]]

Verify that the required products are installed and selected:

Verify the target configuration:

And the debug settings:

Ready to start the first debug session with the `uartecho_CC1350STK_tirtos_ccs` sample project.
The companion tutorial {r8} shows how to activate <<../3-CC2650-ST/index.adoc#logging>>
with the System Analyzer for the CC2650 SensorTag.
The procedure is the same for the CC1350STK.

== Conclusion

The SensorTag is not a full blown development kit and there is a reason why the product page {rTI-1} recommends to use a suitable LaunchPad rather than the SensorTag for development.
However, the corresponing LaunchPad has a much larger footprint and no sensors,
therefore the SensorTag can provide value for small projects and prototypes where
dual BLE/Sub-1GHz connectivity and additional sensors are desirable.
